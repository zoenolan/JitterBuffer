And you should provide some documentation about how your solution works, why you solved it in the way you
did, and what limitations/issues you see in your solution (and how things could be improved). Indicate if you
identified any trade-offs to be made during implementation, and why you decided to resolve them as you did.
Also, keep track of the time spent on this task, and report how long you spent in doing the different things. Try
to keep the total time you spend on this task to no more than 20 hours, and to come up with the best solution that
is practical within this timeframe.

Improving the Interfaces

All the of the int parameters could be const as they are only inputs and since none of them can be negative having them as unsigned int would be better
